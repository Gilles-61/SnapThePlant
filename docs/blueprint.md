# **App Name**: SnapThePlant

## Core Features:

- Live Camera View: The app opens the device's front camera, providing a live feed for identifying plants and wildlife. The camera view takes up the majority of the screen.
- Capture Button: A prominent capture button is available for users to take images of the plants, insects, trees or weeds that they want to identify.
- Category Selection: A selection of icons will enable the user to set a category for their search (e.g., Plants, Trees, Weeds, Insects).
- AI-Powered Identification: The app integrates an AI model. The AI tool will process the image from the camera, and display the species name along with its confidence score. Key information and links for more information are also provided.
- Offline Functionality: To allow for use in remote locations, a significant library of common plants, insects, weeds, and trees will be pre-loaded for offline identification.
- Information Popups: After identification, information popups provide detailed information about the identified object (e.g., habitat, uses, dangers, etc.) including links to user-friendly resources for further reading.
- Feedback Mechanism: Users can confirm or edit the identification results, helping refine AI accuracy through user input.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, natural green (#7CB342) evokes a sense of nature and growth, connecting with the app's theme of plant identification.
- Background color: Light desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), provides a neutral and clean backdrop that imitates the color of dried plant matter. A lighter background optimizes visibility and readability of the app's features.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFB300), used to highlight key interactive elements and buttons in the app (for example, the 'capture' button), or to call attention to key pieces of information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) combines a modern look and a little warmth; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use clear and representative icons for plants, insects, weeds and trees categories to enhance usability and recognition.
- Maintain a minimalistic and intuitive layout with a focus on the camera view and key action buttons, for easy navigation across various age groups.
- Implement subtle, nature-inspired transitions for category changes or information loading to provide a smooth user experience.
